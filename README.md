# Files Manager Project

## Description

This project is a simple file manager that allows you to create, delete, and view files. It is a simple project that I created to learn more about the file system in NodeJS.

## How to use

To use this project, you need to have NodeJS installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). After installing NodeJS, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

User authentication via a token
List all files
Upload a new file
Change permission of a file
View a file
Generate thumbnails for images
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!
